# Tru-Q

## Ambition

To create a Amazon Go style store which would utilize Raspberry Pi's with ultrasonic sensors and cameras, openCV, and AWS IOT tools. The store would use ultrasonic sensors to recognize if an item had been picked up for purchase. Cameras attached to Pis would be utilized in conjunction with openCV to be able to differentiate and count different types of products and verify if any product had been removed or replaced. In addition, the camera would be used for facial recognition to verify the customer who picked up the item and bill their account appropriately.

## Results

It appears we may have bit off more than we could chew. This project requires the majority of the team members to have at least a moderate understanding of the AWS/Azure/GCP. This is a massive project that requires a lot of hardware that we simply didn't have.

## Lessons Learned

 * Research what software/hardware will be necessary and download/buy what you  
 need before hacking begins.
 * Know the limitations of your equipment. -i.e. is a Raspberry Pi 3b capable enough  
 for use in a Machine Learning implementation.
 * Amazon AWS is very large and very intricate. Suggest including AWS  
 in ACM workshops or petition for AWS, Azure, GCP course to be  
 designed for university credit.
